# pronomy-bot
a bot for my discord server

libs: discord.py and .env

i don't remember why, but i made a logging log, but i dont really care since it's made to run only one in a server

.env is for internal references and some code-dry

i made this rep only in case someone steals my computer

i dont know how to use commands, i literraly use on_message

on_member_ events r have their own notes

coinflip system with real world accuracy based on a new penny coin
